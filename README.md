The aim of this project is to train a reinforcement learning agent in a simulated autonomous driving environment. The agent is referred to as a "duckiebot", and it is trained using reinforcement learning in the simulator, then it can be transferred to a real model vehicle in the physical test environment.

The repository contains the simulation environment, and the scripts and configuration files necessary for the trainig.

## Setup and running

After installing the packages specified in the requirements file, the
